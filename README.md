# VR-Zombie-Shooter
Zombie Shooter Game made with Unity VR

The theme we choose reflects our passion for gaming. 
Most of our free time has been spent playing games for a large portion of our lives. 
However, as we got older, we’ve noticed some changes. 
We feel less and lees inclined to play hours of video games, but our love for them has seemed to grow. 
For instance, we used to play hours on end of Skyrim Legendary Edition, never leaving our chairs except for small breaks. 
Now after only two hours of playing games, we feel content for a while. Honestly, at first, we sensed worry.
Video games defined a part of our identity, they were the first thing we become attached to.
The thought of losing them as out passions made us start to question a lot about ourselves.
However, we had a revelation.
As we were watching a gameplay for Dead by Daylight, we felt like the game made an impact on us, and such we thought about other games that gave us such feeling – like Left for Dead 2, Sniper Elite v2.
We felt that as we got older, our love for video games hasn’t changed, but the way we appreciate them has.
The reason we would spend so much time playing video games was because they would fill a stimulus we were missing, like adventure or competition.
As out love for gaming got even bigger, our passion for development also grew alongside it. 
Now we decided to give change a try and make our own video game.
As the gaming industry became bigger, so did the UI. 
Virtual Reality, or VR, is the latest buzzword in the wonderful world of technology.
It’s something that got us excited and we made our own Zombie Shooter VR Game, using Unity 5.6 and Google SDK 1.4.0 – the latest.
